# Rocrastinate
A React/Redux-like UI state management and view library optimized for Roblox game development

Rocrastinate provides UI state management solutions similar to Rodux, and semi-declarative UI similar to Roact. It works with, not against, roblox's features by allowing the use of UI templates, and it optimizes for Roblox development by mutating state and "procrastinating" component updates until the very moment they need to be displayed to the user (i.e. RenderStep or Heartbeat).

Rocrastinate is meant for Roblox Development, and is a more appropriate fit for the Roblox environment than Roact.
