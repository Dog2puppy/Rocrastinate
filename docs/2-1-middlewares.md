## Enhancing the store

Middlewares are a [common way to enhance stores in Redux applications](https://www.codementor.io/vkarpov/beginner-s-guide-to-redux-middleware-du107uyud). Right now, the actions we've created are fairly dumbâ€”all they can really do is get and set data. What if we want to do things like request data from the server?

Rocrastinate supports middlewares, which are simply functions that intercept actions upon being dispatched, and allow custom logic to be applied.
